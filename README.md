# Polkadot Telemetry

## Getting Started
To run the backend, you will need `cargo` to build the binary. We recommend using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).

To run the frontend make sure to grab the latest stable version of node and install dependencies before doing anything:

```
nvm install stable
yarn
```

### Terminal 1 - Backend
```
cd backend
cargo build --release
./target/release/telemetry
```

By default, telemetry will listen on the local interface only (127.0.0.1) on port 8000. You may change both those values:

Use another port:
```
PORT=8123 telemetry
```

You may also change the the listening interface. This is especially required if you are using docker:
```
BIND=0.0.0.0 telemetry
```

### Terminal 2 - Frontend
```
yarn start:frontend
```

### Terminal 3 - Node
Follow up installation instructions from the [Polkadot repo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot)

```
./target/release/polkadot --dev --telemetry-url ws://localhost:8000/submit
```

### Run via Docker
To run via docker make sure that you have Docker Desktop
  - If you dont you can download for you OS here [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```
 - -d stands for detach, if you would like to see logs i recommend using [Kitmatic](https://kitematic.com/) or dont use the -d
 - --build will build the images and rebuild, but this is not required everytime
  - If you want to makes UI changes, there is no need to rebuild the image as the files are being copied in via volumes.

Now navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
