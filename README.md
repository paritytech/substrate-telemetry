# Polkadot Telemetry

## Overview

This repository contains the backend ingestion server for Substrate Telemetry (which itself is comprised of two binaries; `telemetry_shard` and `telemetry_core`) as well as the Frontend you typically see running at [telemetry.polkadot.io](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/).

The backend is a Rust project and the frontend is React/Typescript project.

## Getting Started

To run the backend, you will need `cargo` to build the binary. We recommend using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).

To run the frontend make sure to grab the latest stable version of node and install dependencies before doing anything:

```sh
nvm install stable
yarn
```

### Terminal 1 & 2 - Backend

Build the backend binaries by running the following:

```
cd backend
cargo build --release
```

And then, in two different terminals, run:

```
./target/release/telemetry_core
```

and

```
./target/release/telemetry_shard
```

Use `--help` on either binary to see the available options.

By default, `telemetry_core` will listen on 127.0.0.1:8000, and `telemetry_shard` will listen on 127.0.0.1:8001, and expect the `telemetry_core` to be listening on its default address. To listen on different addresses, use the `--listen` option on either binary, for example `--listen 0.0.0.0:8000`. The `telemetry_shard` also needs to be told where the core is, so if the core is configured with `--listen 127.0.0.1:9090`, remember to pass `--core 127.0.0.1:9090` to the shard, too.

### Terminal 3 - Frontend

```sh
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```

Once this is running, you'll be able to navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the UI.

### Terminal 4 - Node

Follow up installation instructions from the [Polkadot repo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot)

If you started the backend binaries with their default arguments, you can connect a node to the shard by running:

```sh
polkadot --dev --telemetry-url 'ws://localhost:8001/submit 0'
```

**Note:** The "0" at the end of the URL is a verbosity level, and not part of the URL itself. Verbosity levels range from 0-9, with 0 denoting the lowest verbosity. The URL and this verbosity level are parts of a single argument and must therefore be surrounded in quotes (as seen above) in order to be treated as such by your shell.

## Docker

### Building images

To build the backend docker image, navigate into the `backend` folder of this repository and run:

```
docker build -t substrate-telemetry-backend .
```

The backend image contains both the `telemetry_core` and `telemetry_shard` binaries.

To build the frontend docker image, navigate into the `frontend` folder and run:

```
docker build -t substrate-telemetry-frontend .
```

### Run the backend and frontend using `docker-compose`

The easiest way to run the backend and frontend images is to use `docker-compose`. To do this, run `docker-compose up` in the root of this repository to build and run the images. Once running, you can view the UI by navigating a browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

To connect a substrate node and have it send telemetry to this running instance, you have to tell it where to send telemetry by appending the argument `--telemetry-url 'ws://localhost:8001/submit 0'` (see "Terminal 4 - Node" above).

### Run the backend and frontend using `docker`

If you'd like to get things runing manually using Docker, you can do the following. This assumes that you've built the images as per the above, and have two images named `substrate-telemetry-backend` and `substrate-telemetry-frontend`.

1. Create a new shared network so that the various containers can communicate with eachother:

   ```
   docker network create telemetry
   ```

2. Start up the backend core process. We expose port 8000 so that a UI running in a host browser can connect to the `/feed` endpoint.

   ```
   docker run --rm -it --network=telemetry \
       --name backend-core \
       -p 8000:8000 \
       --read-only \
       substrate-telemetry-backend \
       telemetry_core -l 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

3. In another terminal, start up the backend shard process. We tell it where it can reach the core to send messages (possible because it has been started on the same network), and we listen on and expose port 8001 so that nodes running in the host can connect and send telemetry to it.

   ```
   docker run --rm -it --network=telemetry \
       --name backend-shard \
       -p 8001:8001 \
       --read-only \
       substrate-telemetry-backend \
       telemetry_shard -l 0.0.0.0:8001 -c http://backend-core:8000/shard_submit
   ```

4. In another terminal, start up the frontend server. We pass a `SUBSTRATE_TELEMETRY_URL` env var to tell the UI how to connect to the core process to receive telemetry. This is relative to the host machine, since that is where the browser and UI will be running.

   ```
   docker run --rm -it --network=telemetry \
       --name frontend \
       -p 3000:8000 \
       --read-only \
       -e SUBSTRATE_TELEMETRY_URL=ws://localhost:8000/feed \
       substrate-telemetry-frontend
   ```

   **NOTE:** Here we used `SUBSTRATE_TELEMETRY_URL=ws://localhost:8000/feed`. This will work if you test with everything running locally on your machine but NOT if your backend runs on a remote server. Keep in mind that the frontend docker image is serving a static site running your browser. The `SUBSTRATE_TELEMETRY_URL` is the WebSocket url that your browser will use to reach the backend. Say your backend runs on a remote server at `foo.example.com`, you will need to set the IP/url accordingly in `SUBSTRATE_TELEMETRY_URL` (in this case, to `ws://foo.example.com/feed`).

   **NOTE:** Running the frontend container in *read-only* mode reduces attack surface that could be used to exploit
   a container. It requires however a little more effort and mounting additionnal volumes as shown below:

   ```
   docker run --rm -it -p 80:8000 --name frontend \
      -e SUBSTRATE_TELEMETRY_URL=ws://localhost:8000/feed \
      --tmpfs /var/cache/nginx:uid=101,gid=101 \
      --tmpfs /var/run:uid=101,gid=101 \
      --tmpfs /app/tmp:uid=101,gid=101 \
      --read-only \
      parity/substrate-telemetry-frontend
   ```

With these running, you'll be able to navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the UI. If you'd like to connect a node and have it send telemetry to your running shard, you can run the following:

```sh
docker run --rm -it --network=telemetry \
  --name substrate \
  -p 9944:9944 \
  chevdor/substrate \
  substrate --dev --telemetry-url 'ws://backend-shard:8001/submit 0'
```

You should now see your node showing up in your local [telemetry frontend](http://localhost:3000/):

### Build & Publish the Frontend & Backend docker images

The building process is standard. You just need to notice that the `Dockerfile`s are in `./frontend/` and `./backend` and tell docker about it. The context must remain the repository's root though. This is all done for you in the following scripts:

```sh
DOCKER_USER=$USER ./scripts/build-docker-frontend.sh
DOCKER_USER=$USER ./scripts/build-docker-backend.sh
```
