# Polkadot Telemetry

## Overview

This repository contains both the backend ingestion server for Substrate Telemetry as well as the Frontend you typically see running at [telemetry.polkadot.io](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/).

The backend is a Rust project and the frontend is React/Typescript project.

## Getting Started

To run the backend, you will need `cargo` to build the binary. We recommend using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).

To run the frontend make sure to grab the latest stable version of node and install dependencies before doing anything:

```sh
nvm install stable
yarn
```

### Terminal 1 - Backend

```
cd backend
cargo build --release
./target/release/telemetry --help
```

By default, telemetry will listen on the local interface only (127.0.0.1) on port 8000. You may change both those values with the `--listen` flag as shown below:

```
telemetry --listen 0.0.0.0:8888
```

This example listen on all interfaces and on port :8888

### Terminal 2 - Frontend

```sh
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Terminal 3 - Node

Follow up installation instructions from the [Polkadot repo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot)

```sh
polkadot --dev --telemetry-url ws://localhost:8000/submit
```

## Docker

### Run the backend and frontend

Obviously, the frontend need to be aware of the backend. In a similar way, your node will need to connect to the backend.
For the sake of brevity below, I will name the containers `backend` and `frontend`. In a complex environment, you will want to use names such as `telemetry-backend` for instance to avoid conflicts with other `backend` containers.

Let's start the backend first. We will be using the published 'chevdor' images here, feel free to replace with you own image.

```
docker run --rm -i --name backend -p 8000:8000 chevdor/substrate-telemetry-backend -l 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Let's now start the frontend:

```
docker run --rm -i --name frontend --link backend -p 80:80 -e SUBSTRATE_TELEMETRY_URL=ws://localhost:8000/feed chevdor/substrate-telemetry-frontend
```

WARNING: Do not forget the /feed part of the URL...

NOTE: Here we used `SUBSTRATE_TELEMETRY_URL=ws://localhost:8000/feed`. This will work if you test on your laptop but NOT if your backend runs on a remote server. Keep in mind that the frontend docker image is serving a static site running your browser. The `SUBSTRATE_TELEMETRY_URL` is the WebSocket url that your browser will use to reach the backend. Say your backend runs on a remore server at `192.168.0.100`, you will need to set the IP/url accordingly.

At that point, you can already open your browser at [http://localhost](http://localhost/) and see that telemetry is waiting for data.

Let's bring some data in with  a node:

```
docker run --rm -i --name substrate --link backend -p 9944:9944 chevdor/substrate substrate --dev --telemetry-url 'ws://backend:8000/submit 0'
```

You should now see your noe showing up in the telemetry frontend:

### Run via docker-compose

To run via docker make sure that you have Docker Desktop.
If you don't you can download for you OS here [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

- `-d` stands for detach, if you would like to see logs I recommend using [Kitmatic](https://kitematic.com/) or don't use the -d
 - `--build` will build the images and rebuild, but this is not required every time
 - If you want to makes UI changes, there is no need to rebuild the image as the files are being copied in via volumes.

Now navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to view the app.

### Build & Publish the Frontend docker image

The building process is standard. You just need to notice that the Dockerfile is in ./packages/frontend/ and tell docker about it. The context must remain the repository's root though.

```
DOCKER_USER=chevdor ./scripts/build-docker-frontend.sh
```
